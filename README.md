# This repo is used by me for Docker tutorials.
Though without comments the slides are rather useless.

Contents are:

- docker-compose

The mandelbrot application is just a small projekt used as content for the container

# mandelbrot
console based mandelbrot generater

build:  
```make```

run:  
```./mandelbrot <real-middle> <imag-middle> <zoom>```

It is quite slow and janky
